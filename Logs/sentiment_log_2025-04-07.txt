The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!

I get an uneasy feeling when people say, ‘Trust Trump, believe him…’ Economics isn’t about faith — it’s about facts and expertise. We’re playing a game that can only be lost.

I am behind you, even though I lost my job supporting you. Not sure what my future will bring me, and at 58 it's a  hard start over. Most employers pass on people my age unless it's minimum wage which I just can't do.

For decades, America has been exploited in trade while the political class looked the other way. Now that Trump is finally putting our interests first, Wall Street panics and the usual critics cry foul. Let them whine—temporary market dips mean nothing compared to reclaiming
