he authors developed a GAN-based model capable of transforming greyscale images into realistic colour versions, emphasising efficient training with smaller datasets and reduced training times. A key aspect of their work includes a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) that allows for easy image selection, processing, and real-time viewing of the colourised results.
